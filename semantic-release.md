**semantic-release**自动化了整个包的发布工作流程，包含以下：

1. 下次升级版本号
2. 生成发布说明
3. 发布`package`

### Highlights

1. Fully automated release
2. Enforce [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) specification
3. New features and fixes are immediately available to users
4. Notify maintainers and users of new releases
5. Use formalized commit message convention to document changes in the codebase
6. Publish on different distribution channels (such as [npm dist-tags](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dist-tag)) based on git merges
7. Integrate with your [continuous integration workflow](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/recipes/README.md#ci-configurations)
8. Avoid potential errors associated with manual releases
9. Support any [package managers and languages](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/recipes/README.md#package-managers-and-languages) via [plugins](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/plugins.md)
10. Simple and reusable configuration via [shareable configurations](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/shareable-configurations.md)
